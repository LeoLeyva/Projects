    <h3 class = "align">ANTHR 4246 - Human Osteology</h3>
    <p class = "para">This is an intensive laboratory course in the study of human skeletal remains. A detailed knowledge of skeletal anatomy is fundamental to forensic anthropology, bioarchaeology, and the medical sciences. This course teaches students how to identify all 206 bones and 32 teeth of the human skeleton, in both complete and fragmentary states. Students will also learn osteological methods for establishing a biological profile (age-at-death, sex, stature, and biological affinity) and documenting skeletal trauma and pathological lesions. Hands-on laboratory training will be supplemented by case studies that demonstrate the importance of human osteology for criminal investigations in the present and the study of health and violence in the past. The ethics of working with human remains are also discussed.</p>
    <h3 class = "align">ANTHR 4263 - Zooarchaeological Method</h3>
    <p class = "para">This is a hands-on laboratory course in zooarchaeological method: the study of animal bones from archaeological sites. It is designed to provide students with a basic grounding in identification of body part and taxon, aging and sexing, pathologies, taphonomy, and human modification. We will deal only with mammals larger than squirrels. While we will work on animal bones from prehistoric Europe, most of these skills are easily transferable to the fauna of other areas, especially North America. This is an intensive course that emphasizes laboratory skills in a realistic setting. You will analyze an assemblage of actual archaeological bones. It is highly recommended that students also take the course in Zooarchaeological Interpretation (<a class = "cu_links" target = "_blank" href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=33&coid=521603">ANTHR 4264</a>/<a class = "cu_links" target = "_blank" href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=33&coid=521757">ARKEO 4264</a>) offered in the spring.</p>
    <h3 class = "align">ANTHR 4264 - Zooarchaeological Interpretation</h3>
    <p class = "para">This course follows from last semesterâ€™s Zooarchaeological Method. We will shift our emphasis here from basic skills to interpretation, although you will continue to work with archaeological bones. We will begin by examining topics surrounding the basic interpretation of raw faunal data: sampling, quantification,taphonomy, seasonality. We will then explore how to use faunal data to reconstruct subsistence patterns, social structure, and human/animal relations.</p>
