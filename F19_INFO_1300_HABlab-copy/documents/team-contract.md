# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
* Gain invaluable cooperation skills
* Learn from each other
* Meet deadlines that we set for each and are set for us
* Make a good website


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

* Meet deadlines
* Communicate your progress
* Don't force push
* Always contribute
* Be respectful

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

-imessage group chat is how we will communicate
-meet in-person before each milestone at least once
-communicate through commit messages

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
-Emailing
-meeting in person
-occasionally checking in in their office hours (since they are a professor)


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
* One person will keep minutes describing what was discussed in the meeting.
* Another person will schedule the meetings.
* Another person will be responsible for double-checking everything.
* Another person will be responsible for speaking to the client.
* One person will be responsible for bringing up any questions the group may have collectively at office hours.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
* Updates through group chat
* Meetings after each milestone to discuss what could have been done better
* "How can we help you? We are a team and we are in this together!"



7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

* Discuss and then take group vote
* Keep an open-mind
* Consult a table
* Attack the idea and not the person

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

-revisit after each milestone
-revisit when needed if there is conflict
-revisit when there are questions about our roles

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
We will get pizza after our last submission.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
