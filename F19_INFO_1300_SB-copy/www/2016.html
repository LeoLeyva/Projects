        <h4>Origin:</h4>
        <p>This meme originated from a scene in the Spongebob episode of <a href = "https://youtu.be/dKZPRuf2AA0">"Patty Hype,"</a> in which 46,853 angry customers demand that Mr.Krabs give
          them a refund for the negative side effects of the new "Pretty Patties."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "Graph">
        <h4>Applicability:</h4>

    <div>
      <div class = "Para">
        <h4>Origin:</h4>
        <p>This meme originated from a scene in the Spongebob episode of <a href = "https://youtu.be/Z0Pq7Y8gt-8">"Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III,"</a> in which Manray tries to perform a good deed by returning
          Patrick's wallet. Patrick, however, wants no part of the good deed!</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "Graph">
        <h4>Applicability:</h4>
        <p>This meme is typically utilized in order to make a point about
          literally anything-- from something trivial to even a political point--
          through the rationalization aspect of this meme.</p>

    <h3>Dabbing Squidward</h3>

    <div>
      <div class = "Para">
        <h4>Origin:</h4>
        <p>This meme actually did not originate from the show, and it's not a meme either-- it's a vine!
          The hilarity behind this vine is that an amusement park worker, at Universal Park
          Orlando, dabbed on request while wearing a Squidward costume
          <a href = "https://youtu.be/JLmprAaHQoI">"(Dab Squidward)."</a> Despite of the fact that this is neither
          an in-show reference nor a meme, this vine is just as popular as the Spongebob memes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class = "Graph">
        <h4>Applicability:</h4>
        <p>This vine isn't really used in the same ways that memes are; this vine
        is typically only used for a good laugh.</p>
