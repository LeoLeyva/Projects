        <h4>Origin:</h4>
        <p>This meme actually originates from two different Spongebob episodes from top to bottom, respectively: <a href = "https://youtu.be/ewKZStzQOYc">"Not Normal"</a> and <a href = "https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x56akvn">"The Fry Cook Games."</a>
          The top image shows Spongebob's attempt at being "normal" and not his "annoying self"
          in order to appease Squidward. Meanwhile, the latter two images depict various parts from
          the latter episode in which Spongebob gets serious about defeating Patrick and
          winning the Fry Cook Games.
